Drop your .mp3 files here.

Sound files are discovered automatically via sounds/manifest.json.
Add the filename to that list to make it appear in the sound picker dropdowns in Settings.

You can also upload custom MP3 files directly from the Settings > Sounds panel
without editing manifest.json. Uploaded sounds are stored in the browser's
localStorage as base64 and appear alongside the bundled sounds in all dropdowns.

Note: sfx.js only handles the UI click sound. All alert/event sound
configuration is done in app.js and Settings.
